# Recognize Cars with TensorFlow Lite

Android app that - thanks to an object detection TensorFlow Lite model trained on the cars196 dataset https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html -  is able to continuously identify cars seen by the phone’s back camera in real time using the CameraX Image Analysis Use-Case and displaying the most probable classifications as well as where they are situated on the screen.
